You can decide to list only the submissions that are relative to a specific
subset of challenges by turning OFF all the challenges you wish to hide
in the *Select the challenges* section.

From the *Results bar*, shown right above the list of submissions, you can filter the results by status, and/or label.
This will show you only the results that match your search criteria.

It is possible to retire a submission by clicking on the orange button
(trash icon) corresponding to the submission that you wish to retire from
the list of submissions.

You can also get a detailed report about a submission by clicking on the
button with the label "Open".
This will show you further details (e.g., evaluating jobs, produced observations,
submission code) about a submission.
