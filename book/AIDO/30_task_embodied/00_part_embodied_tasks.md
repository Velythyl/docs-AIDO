# Template Solutions {#part:embodied status=ready}

We provide a set of templates for solutions. These templates are fully functional solutions that don't do anything "smart". They will get you a valid score on the leaderboard, but it's unlikely that it will be very good.

Specifically, we provide the following templates:

- [Minimal agent template](#minimal-template) is the most minimal feasible solution for `LF*` challenges,
- [TensorFlow template](#tensorflow-template) for making a submission with a tensorflow model to the `LF*` challenges,
- [PyTorch template](#pytorch-template) for making a submission with a Pytorch model to the `LF*` challenges,
- [ROS template](#ros-template) for making a submission using the robot operating system to the `LF*` challenges,
