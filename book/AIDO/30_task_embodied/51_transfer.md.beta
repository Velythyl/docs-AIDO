# Transferring a Submission to Real Duckietown {#embodied-transfer_sim_to_real status=ready}


This section describes how to get your submission running on your Duckiebot.

<div class='requirements' markdown='1'>

Requires: That you have [built your Duckiebot and set it up](https://docs.duckietown.org/DT18/opmanual_duckiebot/out/building_duckiebot_c0.html)

Requires: You are connected to your robot through a 5GHz wifi link (if running "remotely").

Result: You can see your submission run on your Duckiebot

</div>

Note: always make sure that you `duckietown-shell` is up to date

## Running an Existing Submission

In this case, you have an existing submission that you have already made (i.e. you can view the submission by navigating to https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/humans/submissions/`![submission_number]`.

There are basically two simple steps: 1) Find the name of your docker image, 2) run it.

### Find the Image Associated with your Submission

 - Navigate to https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/humans/submissions/`![submission_number]` where `![submision_number]` is the number of the submission that you would like to test on your robot.

 - Scroll down and click on the triangle next to `29 artifacts` in the row for `step1-simulation`.

 - Scroll down and click on `docker-compose.yaml`. You should see some text that looks like:

```

```

You need to take note of the name of your image: `![username]/![challenge-name]-submission:![date]` - from now on we will refer to it as `![image-name]`

### Running your Submission

On your laptop run:

    laptop $ dts duckiebot evaluate ![robot-name] --image ![image-name]

Where `![robot-name]` is the name of your robot that you are on the same network as (i.e. you can `ssh` into it and `ping` it) and `![image-name]` is the name of the image that you would like to run (the one you found in the previous section).
